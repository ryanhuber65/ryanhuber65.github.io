## URL Service Application

**Application Description:** 
  - This application uses a service that includes notifications using a broadcast receiver and to asynchronously delete saved files when requested by the user.
  - The user enters urls (in the main layout), selects a "Notify" checkbox (optional) and then selects the "Fetch Web Pages" button (which will launch the second activity). Only if the "Notify" checkbox is selected, a notification will be sent through the broadcast receiver. 
  - The second activity will display the url pages in a webview. The urls will be displayed in a spinner and when the user selects one url, it will display in the webview.
  - If the user selects the "Clear" button within the second activity, it will asynchronously delete all the urls and clear the webview.
  -	**Technologies:** Android Studio, Java.
